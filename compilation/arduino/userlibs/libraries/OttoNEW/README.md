# Libraries
This repository have all the main Otto libraries for Arduino IDE mainly for Nano compatible boards but you can use UNO and others in most cases.

## Installation:
How to install the Arduino IDE and libraries?
"There are multiple ways to add libraries to your Arduino IDE after the software is installed the most easy for me is to:
1. [Download the .zip Otto libraries here](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoDIYLib/archive/master.zip)
2. Open Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library''.
3. You will be prompted to select the library. Navigate to the .zip file's location, that you just downloaded and open it.
4. Return to the Sketch > Include Library menu. menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu. That means is ready to use Ottos example codes!

## Compatibility:

Different and similar versions of Otto Libraries are currently included:

Robot  | Library can use
------------- | -------------
DIY  | Otto9
PLUS | Otto9
Eyes* | Otto9 
Wheels  | Otto9
Humanoid  | Otto9Humanoid


*you will need to install [Adafruit_LEDBackpack](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack) and [Adafruit_GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

In order to maintain consistency along the Otto robot remixes we stablished a naming structure: 
Otto_(followed by the component name and version) for example:

* Otto contains all the main functions
* Otto_gestures contains all the gestures functions
* Otto_mouth 	contains all the mouth functions
* Otto_sound contains all the sound functions
* Otto_Matrix contains all the matrix functions

Complementary libraries  are independent of Otto(they can work with other projects) therefore are just named like they are, for example:
* US contains the functions of the ultrasonic sesnor
* Bat Reader contains the functions to meassure the battery.
* All Adafruit libraries better  be installed separately to avoid duplicates and conflicts
 
## Wiring:
We follow these connections in all our robots, buy some Otto do not use all pins so you can play with empty pins to add new sensors or actuators.
